The MPU6050 I2C Device Library provideS simple and intuitive interfaces to MPU6050 I2C device on ARM 32-bit STM32F103xx family of microcontrollers.It has the I2C bit- and byte-level communication for complete coverage of all functionality described by MPU6050 documentation.

The code is written primarily to support the MPU6050 I2C device implementation, but it may be useful to extend it to other I2C devices.

This library depends on <stdbool.h> and use -std=c11 or -std=c99 compiler's option. Also you need:

stm32f4xxx.h
stm32f4xx_i2c.h
stm32f4xx_rcc.h
